# istio-monitoring
A set of alarms to better monitor istiod and Envoy

The files here are based on Prometheus Operator servicemonitor object, however, with a few ctrl+c/ctrl+v it can be adapted to standard Prometheus config.

## Contribute:
Please, feel free to contribute with more alerts and its severity classifications.

## Disclaimer:
Most of this alerts/alarms are based in a (apparently) abandoned thread in Orca project, so Kudos to them: https://github.com/openrca/orca/issues/65
